# Restoring Democracy's Promise

This repository contains the source code for [**restoring-democracy.org**](https://restoring-democracy.org/ "null"), the official web presence for the investigative journalism project, **Restoring Democracy's Promise**.

## Project Mission

Restoring Democracy’s Promise is a newsroom founded on a simple premise: to restore democratic accountability through irrefutable, evidence-driven investigations. We trace the money, map the influence, and expose the hidden machinery of power that shapes American policy from the shadows. This website serves as the front door to our work.

## Website Features

The site is composed of three key components:

1. **Main Landing Page (`index.html`):** A professional landing page that introduces the project's mission, features our flagship investigation, and provides clear calls-to-action for readers to subscribe and get involved.
    
2. **Interactive Financial Report (`pincerfinancial.html`):** A deep-dive, interactive data visualization that maps the "Sustained Financial Superhighway" of the Marble Freedom Trust network. It allows users to explore the flow of hundreds of millions of dollars through various entities over multiple fiscal years.
    
3. **The Editor's Vault (`vault.html`):** A hidden "Easter egg" page for engaged followers, rewarding exploration and hinting at future investigations.
    

## Technology Stack

This is a modern, static website built for speed, security, and accessibility.

- **Framework:** None. Just clean, semantic HTML5.
    
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ "null") for a professional, responsive, utility-first design.
    
- **Interactivity:** Vanilla JavaScript for the interactive timeline and UI elements, with [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/ "null") for data visualization.
    
- **Deployment:** Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ "null") and connected to this GitHub repository for continuous deployment. Every change pushed to the `main` branch is automatically deployed to the live site.
    

## Data Source

The financial data, organizational relationships, and narrative context for the interactive visualization are derived from the "Final Report: The MFT-DonorsTrust Financial Artery," a meta-journalistic investigative piece based on primary source analysis of tax filings and secondary source reporting.
