## 1. Introduction and Scope

At Restoring Democracy‚Äôs Promise (RDP), we are committed to upholding the highest standards of journalistic integrity and data privacy. This policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect data in the context of our advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. This policy applies to all RDP-managed AI systems, including Julia, Alex, and any custom GPTs or AI tools used for reporting, analysis, source management, or editorial support. Our AI tools are designed to augment, not replace, human judgment, and all final decisions remain with our journalists and editors.

## 2. Information We Collect

Our AI systems primarily process information provided by our editorial and research teams. This includes:

* **Content for Analysis:** Text, data, documents, and other media submitted to AI tools for research, drafting, editing, or analysis.
* **Query Data:** Inputs, prompts, and instructions provided to our AI assistants.
* **System Logs:** Technical data related to AI system performance, usage, and error reporting.
* **External Citation Data:** When connected to external citation databases, our AI systems may process information from these sources to verify facts and gather citations. This interaction is designed to retrieve public or licensed data and does not involve collecting personal data from these external databases unless explicitly part of their terms of service.

We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from individuals not directly affiliated with RDP through these AI systems, beyond what is necessary for their operational function.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

The information processed by our AI systems is used exclusively to fulfill our journalistic mission:

* **Research & Analysis:** To assist in deep-dive investigations, data synthesis, pattern recognition, and vulnerability assessments.
* **Content Generation & Editing:** To aid in drafting, editing, and refining journalistic manuscripts and narratives.
* **Fact-Checking & Legal Review:** To stress-test stories for accuracy, identify potential legal vulnerabilities, and enforce sourcing standards.
* **Operational Improvement:** To monitor and improve the performance, accuracy, and efficiency of our AI tools.
* **Compliance:** To ensure adherence to internal policies, ethical guidelines, and legal obligations.

This policy applies to all RDP-managed AI systems, including Julia, Alex, and any custom GPTs or AI tools used for reporting, analysis, source management, or editorial support.

## 4. How We Share Information

Restoring Democracy‚Äôs Promise adheres to strict protocols regarding data sharing:

* **Internal Access:** Access to data processed by AI systems is restricted to authorized RDP personnel on a need-to-know basis.
* **Third-Party AI Models:** When utilizing third-party AI models (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI's GPT models), data shared for processing is done so under strict confidentiality agreements and is limited to what is necessary for the AI to perform its function. We select providers committed to privacy and data security. Our system is model-agnostic to prevent vendor lock-in.
* **External Citation Databases:** Data retrieved from external citation databases is used for internal research and publication purposes, consistent with the terms of service of those databases. No personal user data from RDP systems is shared with these external databases unless explicitly required for authentication or authorized by the user.
* **Legal Compliance:** We may disclose information if legally required to do so by a valid court order or government request.

We do not sell, rent, or trade any data processed by our AI systems to third parties for marketing or other commercial purposes.

## 5. Data Security

We implement robust technical and organizational measures to protect the data processed by our AI systems from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:

* **Encryption:** Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest where feasible.
* **Access Controls:** Strict access permissions are enforced, ensuring only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.
* **Regular Audits:** Our systems undergo regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
* **Secure Infrastructure:** Our AI ecosystem is built on secure, managed infrastructure, including secure document repositories (e.g., GitHub/DocumentCloud).

## 6. Your Rights

While our AI systems primarily process non-personal data related to journalistic work, individuals whose data may be incidentally processed have rights consistent with applicable privacy laws. These may include the right to access, correct, delete, or object to the processing of their data. For any requests regarding your data, please contact us using the information provided below.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

This AI Privacy & Data Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in our practices, technology, or legal requirements. Any new AI service that collects or shares data beyond the limits described here will trigger an update to this policy, with full public notice on our website. We will post the revised policy on our website with an updated "Effective Date."

### üîê Coverage of Future AI Assistants

This policy governs both current and future AI tools deployed by RDP. As we develop or integrate additional GPTs, plugins, and automated editorial tools, we will apply these privacy safeguards by default. Any new AI service that collects or shares data beyond the limits described here will trigger an update to this policy, with full public notice on our website.
